## Installation

### Unity
**TransdecEnvironment** requires latest stable version of Unity development platform and is platform-independent. For Windows and Mac OS X versions visit their site: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download.

The project uses ML-Agents Toolkit Repository for communication with Python scripts. It is not included in the project, therefore it is necessary to clone it by executing this command in a command line:

```git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git```

### Python
For instructions on Python API configuration please go to [**PyTransdec** repository](https://github.com/PiotrJZielinski/PyTransdec).

### The environment
Once installed, clone TransdecEnvironment GitHub repository by executing this command:

```git clone https://github.com/PiotrJZielinski/TransdecEnvironment```

To use the environment launch the Unity Editor and open the project.

Using file explorer navigate to ML-Agents directory and open `UnitySDK/Assets` folder. Inside of `ML-Agents` folder remove `Examples` directory together with `Editor.meta` file. Then, go back to `UnitySDK/Assets` directory and drag the `ML-Agents` folder to the Unity Editor `Project` window.
